# SimPyLIC

SimPyLIC - *Sim*plistic *Py*thon-*L*ike *I*nterpret and *C*ompiler is a
study project of mine, trying to write a simple interpret and x86_64
compiler for a language based on basic Python syntax.

The goal of this project is not to be fully Python compatible, but
rather to learn about how compilers and interprets work under the hood.
